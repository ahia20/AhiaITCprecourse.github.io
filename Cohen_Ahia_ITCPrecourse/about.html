        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
      My name is Ahia, I am 24 years old, and I live in Ra'anana, Israel.          
        </p>

        <p>Coding has always been one of my interests, as I always liked to mess with computers and in my childhood I was primaly concered about making my own website, but now I'm grown up and I feel that I have enough knowladge in computers but also a big gap with all around software and web development, and now I want to take it to the next level!</p>

        <h2>My education & experience</h2>
        <p>
        When I was young I wanted to learn more about computers so I even moved to another school for that purpose, unfortinantly, in my new school there was no trend available to my class - so I went to study on a different old love and interest - arts.
        In my army service - I did a service as a network administrator - which opened my eyes to a new opportunites that I never had before as a "tech guy" of the family, for example -  I was never exposed before to a server room until my army service.
        </p>

        <h2>My interests</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Arts - since the moment I remember myself I was drawing and painting, it was noticible in school when all the kids was running to play football in break times while I wasn't noticed that the break was start and finished - because I was so focused on my drawings.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Computers - as I was so fascinated about computers - my first experience was a disaster - I broke the operating system in order "to make it faster", but I was 6 years old, so my innocence saved me back then. since then I was still curious about computers and I tried a lot to make my first website, and few years later - I got few old computers - so I was happily made my first own research on computers and its components.  
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Writing - Writing stories and poems was another side hobey that I always liked to do, betweem computers and arts, I was writing stories about my life and the people in it.
        This hobey became more developed in my army service, as a lot of people was interested on my army service - I wrote a lot of funny stories and most of my army service landmarks are written down on the text.
